Feature available in a Silverlight grid component and part of a clever workflow: user would copy &amp; paste of selected rows of the grid into Excel document, update the contents in Excel and copy &amp; paste the result back to the grid. Could easily be challenged, because of the risk of massive errors in case of a row offset, and accomplished in other ways in the grid / or with ad-hoc applicative features.</td>
